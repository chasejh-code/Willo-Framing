This is just a small side project for my brothers company. 

I have implemented, to the best of my limited ability, all my online research and coding skills into this website.
By no means am I a web developer, my expertise come from youtube , freecodecamp tutorials and other free courses.
My IT background is minimal, but this is something im dabbling in while learning cyber security and cloud security.


# Willo Framing LLC Website

This repository contains the source code for the official Willo Framing LLC website.  
The site is a modern, responsive, static website designed to showcase the company’s framing services, highlight craftsmanship, and provide customers with a secure and reliable way to get in touch.

# Features

- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean, modern UI with smooth animations
- Lottie-based animated icons
- Services overview and value‑driven “Why Choose Us” section
- Contact form with strong security and spam protection
- Lightweight, fast-loading architecture

# Lottie Animations

The site uses *Lottie animations* to enhance visual engagement without sacrificing
performance.  
Key benefits:

- Vector-based animations that scale cleanly on all devices  
- Extremely small file sizes compared to GIF or video  
- Smooth, high‑quality motion with minimal CPU usage  
- Loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking page rendering  

These animations are used for service icons and section highlights to give the site a
modern, premium feel.

# Secure Contact Form Implementation

The contact form is built using **Web3Forms** combined with **Google reCAPTCHA v3** for
layered security.

# Web3Forms Security
- Server-side validation of all submissions  
- Honeypot fields to block automated bots  
- Rate limiting to prevent spam floods  
- HTTPS encrypted submission  
- No backend server required, reducing attack surface  
- Email address is never exposed in the HTML  

# Google reCAPTCHA v3 Integration
- Invisible bot detection  
- Behavioral scoring to block advanced bots  
- Additional verification layer before Web3Forms processes the request  
- No user interaction required (no puzzles or image grids)  

*Security Mode:* 
Web3Forms is set to **Security: None** because reCAPTCHA v3 is implemented manually in
the frontend, providing stronger and more flexible protection.

# Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Lottie (JSON-based animations)  
- Web3Forms (secure form handling)  
- Google reCAPTCHA v3  
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
